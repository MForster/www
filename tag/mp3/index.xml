This blog post has been imported from my old Blogger
blog. It is more than 10 years old and likely horribly out of date. I have not
updated the content nor fixed any broken links.
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This is the continuation of a short &lt;a href="https://michael.forster.pro/post/tag-mp3-files/">series of blog postings&lt;/a> about how I tag my MP3 files. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll share my
experience in displaying cover art in various media players.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am using two portable players: An &lt;a href="http://www.android.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android phone&lt;/a> and
an &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone&lt;/a>. On my laptop I usually use
&lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTunes&lt;/a>, but sometimes I fall back to &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows
Media Player&lt;/a> because
of its fast startup time. I keep MP3 files in individual folders per album, so I
also want the thumbnail view of Windows explorer to show the cover art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with a short summary of what works for me: Embed cover images into
the first track of every album, and additionally save them as &lt;code>Folder.jpg&lt;/code> files
in the album directories. See below for the long story.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="analysis-of-different-players">Analysis of different players&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are various ways of attaching cover art to MP3 files, and every player
that I use seems to do it slightly differently. Here is what I found out:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>iTunes&lt;/strong> stores cover images in its own proprietary storage in some ITC2
format that I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about
(&lt;code>My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\\Album Artwork\\Download\\6118F104927B998E\\10\\10\\05\\6118F104927B998E-6DBB7171FCCCC5AA.itc2&lt;/code>).
Fortunately, it also shows images that are included in the MP3 files.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The &lt;strong>iPhone&lt;/strong> seems to display whatever iTunes displays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Android&lt;/strong> also works fine with cover images embedded into the MP3 files.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Windows Explorer&lt;/strong> expects cover art in &lt;code>Folder.jpg&lt;/code> files. It does not show
embedded images.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Windows Media Player&lt;/strong> seems to keep cover art in a whole bunch of different
hidden files like &lt;code>Folder.jpg&lt;/code>, &lt;code>AlbumArtSmall.jpg&lt;/code>,
&lt;code>AlbumArt\_{SOME\_GUID}\_Large.jpg&lt;/code>, etc. It does read covers from the MP3 files
however. If you import a MP3 file into the Windows Media Player library it
automatically generates all files. This includes Folder.jpg, which is needed
for Windows Explorer&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In summary, all of my players show images that are embedded in MP3 files. It
seems to be enough to embed a cover image into the first track of an album.
Windows Explorer needs Folder.jpg, which is easiest to create by importing files
into Windows Media Player.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Caveat: Windows Media Player resizes &lt;code>Folder.jpg&lt;/code> files to 200x200 pixels without
asking, so don&amp;rsquo;t use this file as your primary storage. I want my covers to be
600x600 pixels, which seems to be a good compromise between file size and high
quality (e. g. for iTunes cover flow). Because of that I have an additional
&lt;code>Cover.jpg&lt;/code> file in all of my album directories. This is not needed for any
player, but I like to have it there for scripts that I use, e. g. to generate
listings of my files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-and-embedding-cover-images-with-itunes">Getting and embedding cover images with iTunes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before you can embed cover art into an MP3 file you need to have it. Of course
you can scan them yourself, but I find it much easier to use iTunes, which has
many album covers in a very high quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is what you need to do: Import the album MP3s into the iTunes library and
choose &amp;ldquo;Get Album Artwork&amp;rdquo; in the album context menu:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes iTunes does not have a matching cover - then you are back to scanning
yourself. But more often than not you get a cover image. As mentioned above,
iTunes stores it in its own proprietary format, but fortunately it is quite easy
to extract. Open the album and right-click the first track, and then &amp;ldquo;Get Info&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img alt="Get Info" srcset="

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the dialog that opens go to the &amp;ldquo;Artwork&amp;rdquo; tab, select the image and copy it
with Ctrl-C or using the context menu. Then immediately paste it back using the
context menu or Ctrl-V. Click OK and iTunes saves the image directly into the
MP3 file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is worth mentioning, that you can of course also paste the copied image into
your favorite graphics editor, or straight into an Explorer window. The latter
creates a file &lt;code>image 1.bmp&lt;/code>, which you can then convert into a JPEG, e.g., to
use it as &lt;code>Folder.jpg&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to create Folder.jpg yourself, simply import the folder with
your MP3 files (and with the embedded cover) into the Windows Media Player
library. It will then generate &lt;code>Folder.jpg&lt;/code> for you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to tag MP3 files for Android, iTunes, iPhone, and Windows Explorer</title><link>https://michael.forster.pro/post/tag-mp3-files/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michael.forster.pro/post/tag-mp3-files/</guid><description>&lt;div class="alert alert-warning">
&lt;div>
This blog post has been imported from my old Blogger
blog. It is more than 10 years old and likely horribly out of date. I have not
updated the content nor fixed any broken links.
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Being a proud owner of a brand-new &lt;a href="http://www.android.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android&lt;/a> phone and
having a couple of weeks of vacation over the holidays, I decided that this is
the perfect time to reorganize my digital music collection and to rip the last
few CDs for which I had not had the time before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to go through some trial-and-error experiments to find a tagging scheme
that works for me, so I figured that my results might be interesting for others
as well. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to make a mini-series of blog postings that explain
how I tag my MP3 files. I do not claim that this is the one and only tagging
scheme, but it works well for me. If you use a different tagging scheme that
works better for you, please let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tagging-across-devices-players-and-media-types">Tagging across devices, players, and media types&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Being me, I want my music to be tagged perfectly for the handful of devices and
programs that I use. This includes my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPhone&lt;/a>
that I recently used mostly as a media player and now also my Android phone. On
Windows my main audio player is &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iTunes&lt;/a>, but
sporadically I also use &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/de/player/11/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windows Media
Player&lt;/a>,
mainly because it starts up much faster. Finally, I want to use the capability
of the Windows Explorer to show the track titles when viewing tracks in the file
system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tagging MP3s perfectly across these players was more challenging than I
anticipated. It is very important to use the right &lt;a href="http://www.id3.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID3
tags&lt;/a>, and until recently, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even aware of some of
them. Here is my list of features of a &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; tagging scheme:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Files from the same disc (set) should be be recognized as such. If not tagged
correctly, iTunes (and other players) show tracks from the same CD as
belonging to multiple CDs. This happens mostly for compilations. See below
for the solution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Files and folders should show cover art in high quality. I want to see my
cover art when playing a song, when using iPhone/iTunes cover flow, and as
thumbnails in Windows Explorer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The files should play in the correct order. This seems trivial, but
unfortunately it isn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Getting the tagging right is not made easier by the quite diverse collection of
media types in my collection. I have albums of one artist, compilations from
multiple artists, audio books, ballroom dance music, comedy discs, movie sound
tracks, musicals, and so on. I also have a number of single MP3 files of an old
collection of chart samplers that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to keep in their entirety.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-compilations-recognized-as-single-discs">Getting compilations recognized as single discs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For today, I thought, I&amp;rsquo;d get started with how to get single discs recognized as
single discs. Here is a ballroom dancing album that contains tracks from various
artists:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clearly, every track is labeled with the same album name, so one might expect
that iTunes recognizes the tracks as belonging to the same album. Unfortunately,
this is not the case. Here is the result:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;figure >

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iTunes only recognized files as belonging to the same album if they also are
from the same artist. Fortunately, there is a simple way to make iTunes
understand that this is indeed only one album. Just select all tracks, right
click, and select &amp;ldquo;Get Info&amp;rdquo; in the context menu. Then edit the &amp;ldquo;Album Artist&amp;rdquo;
tag to have the same value for all tracks. I usually choose &amp;ldquo;Various&amp;rdquo;, sometimes
&amp;ldquo;Soundtrack&amp;rdquo; or similar. The album artist field is also useful for albums of a
single artist &amp;ldquo;Somebody&amp;rdquo; where individual tracks are from &amp;ldquo;Somebody feat.
Somebody Else&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>I usually do not edit ID3 tags in iTunes. There are quite some decent ID3
editors out there. My favorite one is &lt;a href="http://www.id3-tagit.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID3-TagIT&lt;/a>.
Unfortunately it is not developed any more, but it is still available for
download from several download archives. Here is how I enter the same
information in the &amp;ldquo;Detailed Information&amp;rdquo; editor:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Technically, the &amp;ldquo;Album Artist&amp;rdquo; information is stored in the &amp;lsquo;TPE2&amp;rsquo; ID3 frame
that is &lt;a href="http://www.id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defined&lt;/a> as follows: “The
&amp;lsquo;Band/Orchestra/Accompaniment&amp;rsquo; frame is used for additional information about
the performers in the recording.” Arguably, this definition does not quite match
what we use it for, but all players seem to use it as the &amp;ldquo;album artist&amp;rdquo; as
intended.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know if this explanation was helpful for you. Check back later for other
topics I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about in future postings: Which ID3 version(s) to use,
how to &lt;a href="https://michael.forster.pro/post/mp3-cover-images/">include cover art&lt;/a>, how to handle
sets of two or more discs, audio books, and what else comes to my mind until
then. Let&amp;rsquo;s hope that I find the time.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
