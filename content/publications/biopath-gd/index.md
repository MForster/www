abstract: |
  Biochemical processes in organisms are considered as very large networks
  consisting of reactants, products and enzymes with interconnections representing
  reactions and regulation. Examples are given by the well known Boehringer poster
  [4] and the Biochemical Pathways atlas [5]. These networks are very complex and
  grow fast by the steady progress of knowledge in life sciences.

  BioPath is the result of the Electronic Biochemical Pathways Project [1,3], a
  joint work of research groups at the universities of Erlangen, Mannheim, Passau
  and Spektrum Verlag, Heidelberg. BioPath provides a convenient electronic access
  to biochemical reactions at a high level of detail and explores all advantages
  of an electronic version over a printed one. It uses an innovative algorithm for
  drawing directed graphs [7] based on Graphlet [2].
