  We present a simple linear time algorithm for drawing level graphs with a given
  ordering of the vertices within each level. The algorithm draws in a radial
  fashion without changing the vertex ordering, and therefore without introducing
  new edge crossings. Edges are drawn as sequences of spiral segments with at most
  two bends.
