abstract: |
  A graph with an ordered k-partition of the vertices is radial level planar if
  there is a strictly outward drawing on k concentric levels without crossings.
  Radial level planarity extends level planarity, where the vertices are placed on
  k horizontal lines and the edges are routed strictly downwards without
  crossings. The extension is characterised by rings, which are certain level
  non-planar biconnected components.

  Our main results are linear time algorithms for radial level planarity testing
  and for computing a radial level planar embedding. We introduce PQR-trees as a
  new data structure where R-nodes and associated templates for their manipulation
  are introduced to deal with rings. Our algorithms extend level planarity testing
  and embedding algorithms, which use PQ-trees.
