  The most popular method of drawing directed graphs is to place vertices on a set
  of horizontal or concentric levels, known as level drawings. Level drawings are
  well studied in Graph Drawing due to their strong application for the
  visualization of hierarchy in  graphs. There are two drawing conventions:
  horizontal drawings use a set of parallel lines and radial drawings use a set of
  concentric circles.

  In level drawings, edges are only allowed between vertices on different levels.
  However, many real world graphs exhibit hierarchies with edges between vertices
  on the same level. In this paper, we initiate the new problem of extended level
  drawings of graphs, which was addressed as one of the open problems in social
  network visualization, in particular, displaying centrality values of actors.
  More specifically, we study minimizing the number of edge crossings in extended
  level drawings of graphs. The main problem can be formulated as the extended
  one-sided crossing minimization problem between two adjacent levels, as it is
  folklore with the one-sided crossing minimization problem in horizontal
  drawings.

  We first show that the extended one-sided crossing minimization problem is
  NP-hard for both horizontal and radial drawings, and then present efficient
  heuristics for minimizing edge crossings in extended level drawings. Our
  extensive experimental results show that our new methods reduce up to 30% of
  edge crossings.
