abstract: |
  A track graph is a graph with its vertex set partitioned into horizontal levels.
  It is track planar if there are permutations of the vertices on each level such
  that all edges can be drawn as weak monotone curves without crossings. The
  novelty and generalisation over level planar graphs is that horizontal edges
  connecting consecutive vertices on the same level are allowed. We show that
  track planarity can be reduced to level planarity in linear time. Hence, there
  are O(|V|) time algorithms for the track planarity test and for the computation
  of a track planar embedding.
