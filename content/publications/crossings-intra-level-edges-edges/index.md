  In drawings of hierarchical graphs generated by the conventional Sugiyama
  framework the vertices are positioned on multiple horizontal level lines. This
  drawing style which allows edges only between vertices on different levels is
  well suited for the visualization of a common direction of flow from lower to
  higher levels in a graph.

  In this paper we are interested in reordering the vertices on each level line to
  increase readability of the drawing, i. e., in reducing the number of edge
  crossings. As novelty, we additionally allow the existence of edges with both
  end vertices on a common level, which often occur in practice. Experimentally we
  found out, that we can save about 30% of the crossings compared to the existing
  standard heuristic which ignores those edges.
