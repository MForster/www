abstract: |
  Gravisto, the Graph Visualization Toolkit, is more than a (Java-based) editor
  for graphs. It includes data structures, graph algorithms, several layout
  algorithms, and a graph viewer component. As a general toolkit for the
  visualization and automatic layout of graphs it is extensible with plug-ins and
  is suited for the integration in other Java-based applications.
