  Every planar graph has a concentric representation based on a breadth first
  search, see [21]. The vertices are placed on concentric circles and the edges
  are routed as curves without crossings. Here we take the opposite view. A graph
  with a given partitioning of its vertices onto k concentric circles is k-radial
  planar, if the edges can be routed monotonic between the circles without
  crossings. Radial planarity is a generalisation of level planarity, where the
  vertices are placed on k horizontal lines. We extend the technique for level
  planarity testing of [12,13,15–18] and show that radial planarity is decidable
  in linear time, and that a radial planar embedding can be computed in linear
  time.
