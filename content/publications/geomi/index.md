  This paper describes the GEOMI system, a visual analysis tool for the
  visualisation and analysis of large and complex networks. GEOMI provides a
  collection of network analysis methods, graph lay- out algorithms and several
  graph navigation and interaction methods. GEOMI is part of a new generation of
  visual analysis tools combining graph visualisation techniques with network
  analysis methods.
