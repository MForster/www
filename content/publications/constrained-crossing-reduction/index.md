abstract: |
  The one-sided two-level crossing reduction problem is an important problem in
  hierarchical graph drawing. Because of its NP-hardness there are many
  heuristics, such as the well-known barycenter and median heuristics. We consider
  the constrained one-sided two-level crossing reduction problem, where the
  relative position of certain vertex pairs on the second level is fixed. Based on
  the barycenter heuristic, we present a new algorithm that runs in quadratic time
  and generates fewer crossings than existing simple extensions. It is
  significantly faster than an advanced algorithm by Schreiber [12] and Finnocchi
  [1, 2, 6], while it compares well in terms of crossing number. It is also easy
  to implement.
