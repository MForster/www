abstract: |
  BioPath is a prototype system for the interactive exploration of biochemical
  pathways. It has been developed as an electronic version of the famous
  Boehringer Biochemical Pathways map and offers various ways to access
  information on substances and pathways and to navigate through pathways. This
  paper describes the main features and the software architecture of BioPath.
  The companion paper [11] focuses on the advanced visualization incorporated
  into BioPath.
