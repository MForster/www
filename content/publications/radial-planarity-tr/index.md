  Every planar graph has a concentric representation based on a breadth first
  search, see [24]. The vertices are placed on concentric circles and the edges
  are routed as curves without crossings. Here we take the opposite view. A
  graph with a given partitioning of its vertices onto k concentric circles is
  k-radial planar, if the edges can be routed monotonic between the circles
  without crossings. Radial planarity is a generalisation of level planarity,
  where the vertices are placed on k horizontal lines. We extend the technique
  for level planarity testing of [13, 14, 16â€“18, 20] and show that radial
  planarity is decidable in linear time, and that a radial planar embedding can
  be computed in linear time.
