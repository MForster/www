abstract: |
  In radial drawings of hierarchical graphs the vertices are drawn on concentric
  circles instead of on horizontal lines as in the standard Sugiyama framework.
  This drawing style is well suited for the visualisation of centrality in social
  networks and similar concepts. Radial drawings also allow a more flexible edge
  routing than horizontal drawings, as edges can be routed around the center in
  two directions. In experimental results this reduces the number of crossings by
  approx. 30% on average.

  This paper is the last step to complete the framework for drawing hierarchical
  graphs in a radial fashion. We present three heuristics for crossing reduction
  in radial level drawings of hierarchical graphs, and also briefly cover
  extensions of the level assignment step to take advantage of the increasing
  perimeter of the circles.
