abstract: |
  We present a new method for the application of 2-layer crossing reduction
  algorithms to layered compound graphs. It is based on an algorithm by Sander
  [9, 7, 8] and improves it with fewer crossings. Our method is optimal in the
  sense that it does not introduce unnecessary crossings by itself. If used with
  an optimal 2-layer crossing reduction algorithm, the crossing reduction for
  2-layer compound graphs is optimal, too.
