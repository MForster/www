abstract: |
  Biochemical reactions in organisms form large and complex networks. Examples are
  given by the Biochemical Pathways atlas [17] and the well known Boehringer
  Biochemical Pathways poster [16], see Figure 1. Biochemists are familiar with
  visual representations of reactions and reaction networks. Automatic
  visualizations help in understanding the complex relations between the
  components of the networks and in extracting information from the data. They are
  very useful for building sophisticated research tools.
